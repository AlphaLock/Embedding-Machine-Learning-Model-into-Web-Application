Sepsis Prediction API
Overview
This FastAPI project provides an API for predicting sepsis based on a set of patient data. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions. The API accepts patient data as input and returns a prediction of whether sepsis is likely or not.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dataset
The sepsis prediction model was built using a dataset downloaded from kaggle containing patient information. The dataset columns include:

PRG: Patient's PRG (Placeholder for a feature)
PL: Patient's PL (Placeholder for a feature)
PR: Patient's PR (Placeholder for a feature)
SK: Patient's SK (Placeholder for a feature)
TS: Patient's TS (Placeholder for a feature)
M11: Patient's M11 (Placeholder for a feature)
BD2: Patient's BD2 (Placeholder for a feature)
Age: Patient's Age

Data Preprocessing
Before training the machine learning model, data preprocessing steps were performed, including:

Handling missing values
Scaling numerical features
Encoding categorical features (if applicable)
Machine Learning Model
Model Building
A logistic regression model was chosen as the machine learning algorithm for sepsis prediction due to its interpretability and good performance on the given dataset. The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure robustness.

Model Deployment
The trained logistic regression model was saved as logreg_model.joblib and is used by the FastAPI API for making sepsis predictions.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
FastAPI
Uvicorn
joblib

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sepsis-prediction-api.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd sepsis-prediction-api
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Start the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default.

Send a POST request to the /predict/ endpoint with patient data. You can use tools like curl or Postman to test the API. Here's an example using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"PRG\": 1.0, \"PL\": 2.0, \"PR\": 3.0, \"SK\": 4.0, \"TS\": 5.0, \"M11\": 6.0, \"BD2\": 7.0, \"Age\": 25.0}"
Replace the sample data with the patient's actual data.

The API will respond with a prediction in JSON format:

json
Copy code
{"prediction": 1}
Where 1 indicates a positive sepsis prediction, and 0 indicates a negative prediction.

Customization
You can replace the pre-trained machine learning model in the logreg_model.joblib file with your own model trained on relevant patient data.
Deployment
To deploy this FastAPI project in a production environment, you can use platforms like Docker and deploy it on cloud services or on-premises servers.
